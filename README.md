# 👋 Hey, I'm Greg Ogun.

I’m a self taught developer with a focus on designing and building scalable, maintainable and accessible solutions on the web.

I work mainly on the frontend writing React code, however I'm also becoming interested in the fullstack approach, with some knowledge around Node.js and GraphQL that I aim to build on through personal projects.
